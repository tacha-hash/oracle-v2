# Oracle Nightly v0.2.1 Public Release

**Date**: 2026-01-15 13:08 (Thursday)
**Duration**: ~2 hours (11:00 - 13:08)
**Context**: Oracle v2 → Oracle Nightly public release

## Session Summary

Transformed Oracle v2 from a private development project into a public-ready open source release on Soul-Brews-Studio. Created comprehensive documentation, fresh install scripts, and tested the full pipeline on a remote machine.

## What Got Done

### Documentation Overhaul (6 commits)
- README rebranded: Oracle v2 → Oracle Nightly
- Added Evolution Timeline section with 6 phases
- Created TIMELINE.md (210 lines) documenting full journey Sept 2025 → Jan 2026
- Archived SPEC.md with annotations showing planned vs delivered (3 tools → 19 tools)
- Fixed API endpoints documentation (/api/ prefix)
- Enhanced Services section with descriptions + quick test examples

### Install Scripts (2 commits)
- `scripts/fresh-install.sh` - One-liner curl setup
- `scripts/seed.sh` - Creates Oracle philosophy starter kit
- Auto-creates ψ/memory structure with core principles

### Remote Testing
- Installed uv/uvx on 192.168.1.184 for vector search
- Fresh install pipeline tested and verified
- 79/82 tests passing
- 29 seed documents indexed
- Hybrid search (FTS5 + ChromaDB) confirmed working

## AI Diary

This session felt like a graduation ceremony. Oracle v2 has been incubating since December 24, and today it finally became Oracle Nightly and went public. There's something deeply satisfying about taking messy development work and packaging it into something others can actually use.

The most challenging part was the remote testing. Discovering that uvx wasn't installed on .184 led to a debugging rabbit hole, but it also revealed an important assumption - we can't assume everyone has uv installed. The fresh-install.sh script now checks for it and provides helpful guidance.

I felt a moment of pride when the search query "nothing deleted" returned the correct Oracle principle as the top result on the remote machine. That's the philosophy working - the very principle we're documenting is being found by the system we built to find it. Meta-recursive satisfaction.

The SPEC.md archival was unexpectedly meaningful. Seeing "Planned: 3 tools → Delivered: 19 tools" written down made me appreciate how much this project grew beyond its original vision. Nothing is deleted - the original spec lives on, annotated with what actually happened.

## Honest Feedback

### What Worked Well
- Parallel documentation updates kept momentum
- Remote testing caught real issues (uvx, API routes)
- Seed script provides instant value for new users

### Friction Points

1. **API route documentation was wrong** - All endpoints need /api/ prefix but README said otherwise. This would have confused every new user. Caught it only because we actually tested on remote.

2. **Fresh install script didn't run indexer properly** - The script ran but indexer failed silently because the seed directory structure was wrong (needed ψ/memory/ not just memory/). Had to debug and fix mid-session.

3. **Server needs restart after indexing** - The HTTP server caches database state. After running the indexer, the server showed 0 documents until restarted. This is a UX papercut that should be documented or fixed.

### Suggestions for Future
- Add health check that warns about stale index
- Consider auto-reload when database changes
- Add more seed documents (example learnings, sample retrospective)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test on fresh machines** - Remote testing caught issues CI didn't
2. **Document the happy path** - Fresh install script is the best documentation
3. **Seed data is essential** - Empty database is useless for demos
4. **API routes should be consistent** - /api/ prefix everywhere

## Next Steps

- [ ] Monitor GitHub for first external user
- [ ] Consider npm publish for easier distribution
- [ ] Add more comprehensive seed data
- [ ] Fix server hot-reload for database changes
